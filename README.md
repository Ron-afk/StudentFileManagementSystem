## Student file management system for BC high school

This is a student file management system designed for BC high school. This application can store basic information for 
students in the school. Information includes student's name, PEN, address, contact information (address, email address,
phone number, emergency contact). Also, it can track students' academic information including courses took, grades, 
planed courses for following semester, and required course for their dreaming university program. For more detail, it 
will also hold detailed information for their courses, for example teacher for courses, and weekly schedule. 

I have planned to build a similar system for years back to when I worked in a private high school as an officer. I found
at the start of each term, we need to spend a lot of time to plan courses for students as most of their record are paper-based,
and they are hard to tracking. With this system, it will be much easier to find student's information and track their 
academic history.
